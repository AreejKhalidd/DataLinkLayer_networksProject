# Data_Link_Layer_Protocols_Simulation
In this project, you will develop, simulate and test data link layer protocols between peers that are  connected with a noisy channel, where the transmission is not error-free, packets may get corrupted,  duplicated, delayed, or lost, and the buffers are of limited sizes
